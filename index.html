          <h1>Twisting up history!</h1>
          <p>The Catholic Church played a major role in the history of Soft Pretzels. During the seventh century, it was a major food that could be consumed during Lent. Especially because meat, eggs, and dairy were not allowed.
          </p>
          <p> The first pretzels were baked as a soft, squishy bread, like the soft pretzels of today. Some say they were originally called “bracellae"
          </p>
          <p> One rumor has it that the doughy knots came over on the Mayflower, and were used by the Pilgrims for trade with the Native Americans they met in the New World.
